# 👾 Space Invaders: Groove Edition 🎵

This is a **fork** of the classic Space Invaders game built with Pygame, originally created by [educ8s](https://github.com/educ8s/Python-Space-Invaders-Game-with-Pygame).

### 🔊 Generative Soundtrack Loop System
I had fun implementing a new sound system where the game creates unique sound patterns (beat and melody) based on in what order you shoot down the invaders. 

#### Jingles and sounds were created in collaboration with the music composer [Agostino Rita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agostino-rita/).
